Introduction
============
This series of pages is intended to guide a competent Python programmer through the stages needed to buld GUI programs using the wxPython framework.

Why I am writing this
+++++++++++++++++++++

I taught myself to write GUI applications in `wxPython <https://www.wxpython.org/>`_; a sometimes painful and protracted experience. Here, I want to share with others what little wisdom I have amassed in this process. I wish I'd have had this guide by my side when I started; it would have saved many hours of trial and error.

Why choose wx python?
+++++++++++++++++++++

I assume that you are already committed to using `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ to develop applications and that you now need or want to develop GUI applications. There is a "native" python GUI framework, `tkinter <https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html>`_, but on my initial investigation I felt that wxPython looked better. I freely admit that I might have been wrong about that. That said, wxPython does have all of the necessary widgets that I want and, in my opinion, looks great on linux, Windows and OSX.

Style
+++++
I have chosen to assume that the reader knows nothing about wxPython. A few web searches will find lots of examples of wxPython code snippets, but these have often been put together to demonstrate a point and there treatment is often not rigorous. I am not claiming that my style is optimal, but it does have the advantage of providing solutions that are consistent, effective and compatable with the main PC platforms: linux, Windows and OSX.

This series of postings is not intended to cover all aspects of wxPython programming and should not be considered as a reference document. Instead, I hope you will read and follow the examples in detail and in sequence. Each posting should take no more than 30 minutes, and so, if you pace youself over a week, you will gain an understanding of wxPython. You will understand how to use it and not just parrot recipes from examples.

Prerequisites
+++++++++++++

I am assuming that you have `downloaded <https://wxpython.org/pages/downloads/index.html>`_ wxPython and that you have a working knowledge of Python; in particular object based programming techniques including `class definition <https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/classes.html>`_, `inheritance <https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/classes.html#inheritance>`_ and Python's treatment of a function or method call as an object.
